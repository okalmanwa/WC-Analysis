# FIFA World Cup Analysis Project

## Background and Context

In this project, our focus lies in unraveling the dynamics of the FIFA World Cup, specifically honing in on the impact of tournament progression on the nature of play. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of match statistics, we center our analysis on expected goals (xG) to discern how the transition from the group stage to the knockout rounds influences the attacking intensity of participating teams.

The application of statistical measures to predict match outcomes not only holds significance in the realm of sports analytics but also provides valuable insights into human behavior in competitive scenarios. Through the fusion of data analytics and robust statistical methods, we aim to explore strategic adaptations and team performances, ultimately contributing to a nuanced understanding of football tactics. Furthermore, our study opens the door to investigating the effects of psychological and environmental factors on high-level competition.

## Research Question
